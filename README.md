// Notes: This program will create a Tuple, no matter what's inside it,  
//        and attempt to add all that is numeric to a global variable, 
//        and cast all that is string-castable to a global variable.
//        Whatever is not accepted will be counted. The end result will
//        will be printed out by main().
// 
//        This program was built and tested with C++17.
